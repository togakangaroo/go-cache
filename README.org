Here is the problem as stated

Write a simple, performant in-memory cache system
- with expiration.

Your cache system
- should allow storing key-value pairs,
- retrieving values by keys
- and automatically removing items that are expired.

In addition, your code
- should be thread-safe,
- handle errors appropriately
- and follow standard GO idiomatic practices.

We value
- well-documented
- clean code
- that is modular
- and easy to extend in the future.

After completing the project, please consider what you’d do differently and/or what you’d add if you had more time.

Assessment Delivery - Present your assessment to a public repository of your choice; github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc. Send the link to me (Tyler via email) when you complete it. I will forward it on to the team for review and will reach back out with next steps.
